## Initiatives & Updates

### Ambire implements L1 provider configuration during onboarding

Thread to be posted about this on the Walletbeat project account:

And then they tweeted this:

**Outreach:**

- Gridplus: “currently stuck internally, waiting for approval. I mostly answered everything, just need a couple of final tweaks.”
  - I will ping their team again next week to see when we can expect their responses but it sounds like we’ll for sure get something from Gridplus
  - Have not heard back from anyone else will continue to ping. I can share the questionnaire with others if anyone has a warm intro to folks at other wallet teams, otherwise I will continue with the cold outreach

### Branding / marketing

Still iterating through logo, colors, and typography system.  
Work timeboxed to continue throughout February and March.
