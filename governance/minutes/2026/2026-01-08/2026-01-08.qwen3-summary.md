## Main Segments of the Call

### Segment 1: Work Done Since Last Meeting

**Topic**: Updates on progress since the previous meeting.

**Purpose**: To provide an overview of accomplishments since the last meeting, identify remaining work, and show progress on key initiatives.

**Progress Summary**:

- polymutex:
  - Fixed GitHub PRs so they no longer appear as "Ghost PRs"
  - Completed the node attribute refactor, renamed to "L1 provider independence attribute" with a detailed guide for evaluation
  - This attribute tests if wallets can function with only L1 RPC endpoints (most fail this test, with Ambire and Safe being the only exceptions)
  - The CEO of Ambire committed to fixing their implementation (noted in a public tweet)
  - Created a Treasury Transparency Tool to publicly document on-chain treasury operations
  - Updated the address resolution attribute to remove chain-specific addressing as a Stage 1 requirement
  - Started a conference travel spreadsheet (later migrated to a Doc after Fileverse spreadsheet issues)

- Mattmatt:
  - Completed Transaction Legibility attribute, which now provides detailed wallet-specific information about message signing, transaction details, and network information
  - Added wallet test page functionality (still in progress)
  - Added a news page for wallet security incidents (noting recent Trust Wallet hack and Ledger data breach)
  - Implemented "permissionless integration" for hardware wallet connectivity

- Hester:
  - Highlighted MetaMask's wallet test page (https://metamask.github.io/test-dapp/) as a resource for WalletBeat

- Luci:
  - Fixed Windows-specific build issues (PR #423)

- Davide:
  - Working on order flow transparency attribute, which involves:
    - Running a server to collect priority fee data from wallets (Metamask, Phantom, Rainbow, and others)
    - Analyzing how much users are overpaying for priority fees
    - Developing a methodology to trace transaction originators based on priority fee patterns

**Debate/Unresolved Questions**: None specific to this segment.

**Actions/Follow-up**:

- Continue working on remaining attributes (orderflow transparency, duress resistance, key material handling)
- Polish the data collection tool
- Add more wallet ratings
- Complete branding work
- Make the site mobile-friendly

### Segment 2: Decisions to Make

**Topic**: Two key architectural decisions needing group input.

**Purpose**: To resolve how to integrate the 1TS security benchmark with WalletBeat's existing stage system without creating confusion for users or wallet developers.

**Decision #1: 1TS Security Benchmark Integration**

**Problem**: WalletBeat uses a stage system (0-2) for rating wallets across multiple categories (security, privacy, transparency, self-sovereignty, ecosystem alignment). The 1TS initiative (funding WalletBeat) has a security-focused benchmark with three levels (1-3). The challenge is how to integrate this security benchmark while maintaining WalletBeat's broader scope.

**Options Proposed**:

- **Option A**: Keep 1TS benchmark as a separate rating system
  - Pros: No changes to existing WalletBeat system
  - Cons: Two rating systems on the site could confuse users

- **Option B**: Fold 1TS into WalletBeat's stage system (expanding to 0, 0.5, 1, 2)
  - Stage 0 = old stage 0
  - Stage 0.5 = old stage 0 + 1TS level 1
  - Stage 1 = old stage 1 + 1TS level 2
  - Stage 2 = old stage 2 + 1TS level 3
  - Pros: Single coherent rating system
  - Cons: Decimal points might confuse developers

- **Option C**: Flatten 1TS to two levels and fold into existing stages
  - Stage 0 = old stage 0
  - Stage 1 = old stage 1 + 1TS level 1
  - Stage 2 = old stage 2 + 1TS levels 2-3
  - Pros: Simpler rating system
  - Cons: Might not reflect security progression accurately

**Debate**:

- Mattmatt and polymutex both lean toward Option B (with some mapping differences)
- Hester questioned whether privacy attributes (e.g., private transactions) should be considered security-related
- polymutex noted that privacy is closely related to security but WalletBeat has historically categorized them separately
- The main tension is between having a single coherent rating system versus maintaining WalletBeat's broader scope

**Unresolved Questions**:

- How to precisely map 1TS levels to WalletBeat stages
- Whether privacy should be fully integrated into the security benchmark
- Whether to have the decimal stage point (0.5)

**Actions/Follow-up**:

- Hester to review the GitHub discussion (issue #407) and provide feedback
- Frederick (1TS representative) to be consulted
- Decision to table this discussion until Hester has reviewed the documentation

**Decision #2: Site Localization**

**Problem**: Bruce Xu (Chinese Ethereum community) proposed creating a Chinese localized version of WalletBeat. However, the site isn't currently localization-friendly, requiring significant infrastructure work before any localization could happen. The team needs to determine if this is worth the effort.

**Pros**:

- Expands WalletBeat's reach to a larger audience
- Makes WalletBeat eligible for language-specific ecosystem grants (e.g., GCC for Chinese)
- Could potentially open funding opportunities

**Cons**:

- Significant infrastructure work required
- Not worth the effort if only one non-English language is supported
- Could delay launch priorities

**Solutions Proposed**:

- First make the site localization-friendly (infrastructure work)
- Then get translations for Chinese and Spanish
- Apply for grants to fund the translation work

**Debate**:

- Mattmatt questioned whether it's worth the effort at the moment
- Luci noted that many L2 sites launch without translation and add it later
- polymutex stressed that localization is not a launch priority but worth doing in Q2

**Unresolved Questions**:

- What grants are available for Spanish translation?
- Is it worth making the site localization-friendly before launch?

**Actions/Follow-up**:

- Luci to investigate Spanish translation grants
- Not to focus on localization before launch (priority is finishing methodology)
- Plan to do localization in Q2 after launch
- If pursuing Chinese localization, first make the site localization-friendly

### Segment 3: This Year's Priorities

**Topic**: Prioritizing work for the year.

**Purpose**: To establish the project's focus for the remainder of the year, ensuring the team concentrates on the right initiatives at the right time.

**Priority #1: LAUNCH**

**Problem**: Need to launch the site before focusing on other initiatives, but several blocks remain before launch.

**Blockers**:

- Methodology: Need to finish software wallet attributes:
  - Orderflow transparency (difficult to implement without wallet team cooperation)
  - Duress resistance (needs clear definition)
  - Key material handling (needs definition)
  - Transaction legibility (need to fold in transaction simulation)

- Site data: Need more wallet ratings (e.g., Phantom, Rainbow are notably absent)

- UI/UX: Branding in progress, mobile UX in progress

**Solutions Proposed**:

- polymutex working on data collection tool to make it easier to collect wallet data
- Mattmatt backfilling wallet data (OKX Wallet, Bitget, and others)
- ren2140 created a questionnaire to help wallet teams contribute data without technical expertise
- Branding work (Luci, Mattmatt, Teresa, Pablo)
- Mobile UX work by Darryl (current progress) and Teresa (designing mobile UI)

**Debate**: No significant debate on priorities, just consensus on what needs to happen before launch.

**Actions/Follow-up**:

- Finish remaining attributes
- Get more wallet ratings (especially Phantom and Rainbow)
- Continue branding work
- Make the site mobile-friendly
- Create contributor guides (video format being considered)

**Priority #2: Spread Awareness, Become Credible**

**Problem**: WalletBeat needs to become a trusted source that wallet developers actually care about.

**Solutions Proposed**:

- Social media strategy (in progress with Mattmatt and Pablo)
- Conference attendance (travel spreadsheet being updated)
- Strong branding (in progress)
- Grow contributor base to 5 people for multisig (currently 4: polymutex, Mattmatt, PatrickAlphaC, niard; Luci volunteering)
- Make data portable and usable by others (WalletRadar is already using WalletBeat data)

**Debate**: No major debate, just consensus on the importance of building credibility before launch.

**Actions/Follow-up**:

- Continue social media strategy
- Update conference travel spreadsheet
- Work on branding
- Grow contributor base to 5 for multisig
- Ensure data exports are machine-readable

**Priority #3: Post-Launch Continuation**

**Problem**: After launch, the project needs to continue developing and expanding.

**Solutions Proposed**:

- Finish hardware wallet methodology
- Develop embedded wallet methodology
- Rate both types of wallets
- Ramp up social media strategy
- Localization (Chinese and Spanish)

**Debate**: No major debate.

**Actions/Follow-up**:

- Finish hardware wallet methodology
- Develop embedded wallet methodology
- Plan localization for Q2

- Mattmatt to demonstrate the wallet test tool once it's ready for public use (with proper disclaimers)

## High-Level Summary

This meeting was the first WalletBeat Contributors Sync for 2026. The primary focus was on preparing for the launch of WalletBeat, with the team identifying key blockers and establishing clear priorities for the next two weeks and the remainder of the year.

The most significant discussion centered on how to integrate the 1TS security benchmark with WalletBeat's existing stage system (0-2), with the team leaning toward Option B (expanding to 0, 0.5, 1, 2 stages) but tabled the decision pending Hester's feedback. The team also discussed site localization, deciding it's not a launch priority but worth pursuing in Q2 after launch.

The team made substantial progress on the L1 provider independence attribute, with most wallets failing the test. The CEO of Ambire committed to fixing their implementation, which polymutex considered a major success for WalletBeat.

For the immediate future, the team prioritized:

1. Completing the remaining attributes (particularly order flow transparency and transaction simulation)
2. Getting more wallet ratings (especially Phantom and Rainbow)
3. Making the data collection process easier for contributors
4. Continuing branding work and preparing for conference attendance

The team agreed to schedule the next meeting in two weeks, rotating time zones to make it more accessible to contributors across different time zones. The meeting was noted as being lengthy (80 minutes), with polymutex noting they'd need to be careful with meeting duration in the future.

The team also made progress on the Treasury Transparency Tool, which documents on-chain treasury operations, and began planning for social media strategy to build credibility and spread awareness after launch.
