"What is the Walkaway Test?"

Simply put: if the team stopped working on the wallet tomorrow and shut down its infrastructure, would users still be able to use it? Would its security or self-sovereignty features degrade?

The test covers many security and self-sovereignty attributes. Questions such as:

- Does the wallet critically rely on any centralized service?
- Can users still transact trustlessly?
- Can users still port their account to other wallets permissionlessly?
