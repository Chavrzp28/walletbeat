		Hardware wallets are physical devices that store a user's private keys offline,

		private keys isolated from internet-connected devices, hardware wallets protect
		users from malware, phishing attacks, and other security vulnerabilities that
		could compromise their funds.

		Supporting multiple hardware wallet manufacturers preserves a healthy,
		open, competitive, interoperable market for hardware wallets. It also
		increases the total addressable market of users for the software wallet,
		as users that already own a specific hardware wallets will want to use a
		software wallet that supports it.

		Wallets are evaluated based on whether they directly integrate with

		manufacturers:

		${majorHardwareWalletManufacturers

		* ${hardwareWalletTypeToString(m, null)}`,
			)
			.join('')}

		Hardware wallets accessible only through WalletConnect are not counted,
		as they require relying on WalletConnect and external software beyond the
		wallet itself in order to function.

		A wallet receives a partial rating if it supports only two such
		hardware wallets manufacturers (without relying on WalletConnect or
		external software).

		A wallet fails this attribute if it only directly supports hardware wallets
		from a single manufacturer.

		Wallets that do not directly support hardware wallets at all are exempt,
		as this check is only about hardware wallet *interoperability*.
		General direct hardware wallet support is also part of Walletbeat's
		security criteria as a separate attribute.
