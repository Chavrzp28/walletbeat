		Hardware wallets are physical devices that store a user's private keys offline,
		providing an additional layer of security against online threats. By keeping
		private keys isolated from internet-connected devices, hardware wallets protect
		users from malware, phishing attacks, and other security vulnerabilities that
		could compromise their funds.

		When a software wallet supports hardware wallets, users can enjoy the
		convenience and features of the software wallet while maintaining the
		security benefits of keeping their private keys offline. This combination
		offers the best of both worlds: a user-friendly interface with enhanced security.
	`),
	methodology: markdown(`
		Wallets are evaluated based on whether it is possible to use them in
		conjunction with any physically-separate hardware wallet.
		This means the software wallet must provide the same level of
		functionality as when not using a hardware wallet, and the private key
		must never leave the hardware wallet.

		Wallets that require the use of a separate software component (e.g.
		WalletConnect to an external desktop application that does the actual
		interfacing with the hardware device) in order to use the hardware wallet
		get a partial rating. The need for this additional software component
		means the user has to do more work to get the hardware wallet working,
		which decreases the likelihood that users will actually do so in practice.
