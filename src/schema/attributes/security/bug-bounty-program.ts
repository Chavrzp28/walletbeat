		Hardware wallets manage sensitive cryptographic keys and access to users' funds, making them high-value targets for attackers.
		Bug bounty programs incentivize security researchers to responsibly discover and disclose vulnerabilities, rather than exploit them.
		
		A well-structured bug bounty program:
		1. Provides clear guidelines for researchers to report vulnerabilities
		2. Offers appropriate rewards based on severity of findings
		3. Demonstrates a commitment to addressing security issues quickly
		4. Communicates transparently about discovered vulnerabilities and their resolution
		
		Additionally, hardware wallets should provide upgrade paths for users when critical security issues are discovered,
		as these physical devices can't always be fixed with simple software updates.

		Hardware wallets are assessed based on the comprehensiveness of their bug bounty program:

		1. **Pass (Best)**: Implements a comprehensive bug bounty program with:
			- Active program accepting vulnerability reports
			- Full coverage of hardware, firmware, and software components
			- Competitive financial rewards based on severity
			- Responsive disclosure process
			- Transparent communication about fixes
			- Clear upgrade paths for users when needed

		2. **Partial**: Implements a basic bug bounty program with limitations:
			- May have limited coverage (only certain components)
			- Smaller or unclear rewards
			- Basic vulnerability disclosure policy without formal rewards
			- Slower response times
			- Unclear upgrade paths for users
			- Inactive or temporarily paused programs

		3. **Fail**: No bug bounty program or security update process:
			- No formal process for reporting vulnerabilities
			- No incentives for responsible disclosure
			- No clear path for providing security updates
			- Known critical vulnerabilities remain unaddressed
